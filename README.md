# Project README: Generative AI Text Application

Welcome to the Generative AI Text Application project! This application leverages various libraries and technologies to enable text generation using OpenAI's GPT-3.5, LangChain, and Streamlit. Additionally, it utilizes FIASS for text embeddings, enabling advanced functionality for studying, copying, and pasting text from PDFs, internet sources, and chatting with the text.

## Libraries Used

### 1. OpenAI's GPT-3.5
OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model is at the core of this application. It is a state-of-the-art language model capable of understanding and generating human-like text based on input prompts.

### 2. LangChain
LangChain is another key component of the application. It likely serves as a tool for managing and processing text data, possibly providing preprocessing or post-processing capabilities to enhance the text generation process.

### 3. Streamlit
Streamlit is used for building the user interface of the application. It offers a simple and intuitive way to create interactive web applications with Python, making it ideal for showcasing the capabilities of the generative AI text application to users.

### 4. FIASS (Feature Importance-aware Sentence Similarity)
FIASS is employed for text embedding within the application. This library likely calculates feature importance-aware sentence similarity, which can be crucial for tasks like text similarity comparison and clustering.

## Functionality

The Generative AI Text Application enables users to:

- Study text by interacting with GPT-3.5 and receiving informative responses based on provided prompts.
- Copy and paste text from various sources such as PDFs and the internet, allowing for seamless integration of external content into the application.
- Chat with the text, engaging in conversational exchanges facilitated by the powerful language capabilities of GPT-3.5.
- Utilize FIASS for advanced text embedding and similarity analysis, enabling tasks such as text clustering and similarity comparison.

## How to Use

To run the Generative AI Text Application:

1. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Launch the application by executing the main script.
3. Interact with the intuitive user interface provided by Streamlit to explore the application's functionalities.
4. Experiment with different prompts, text sources, and chatting scenarios to experience the full capabilities of the generative AI text application.
